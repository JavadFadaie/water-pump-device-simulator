project simulation in grok : https://grok.com/chat/772c7d0f-fcdf-4eaa-ba09-17750d775b66
what we need to do for the simulator fist

it receve some driver about the pump that we want to simualte
and it should specifies some internal values 


to write the drvier forthe simulation, we need to define first the function which store the diffrent devices and its charachteristics 



1. I have to be able to have two drvier and make the 
2.  diriver simulation as abstract and
3. and write the cmake that contain all the driver and put it in the signle 
4. design the web UI and try to controll all the functionalyitiy inside the web UI
5. find a way to to write the register into some register and try to have the slcore that could read this register at the same time
