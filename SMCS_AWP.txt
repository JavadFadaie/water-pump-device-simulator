project simulation in grok : https://grok.com/chat/772c7d0f-fcdf-4eaa-ba09-17750d775b66
what we need to do for the simulator fist

it receve some driver about the pump that we want to simualte
and it should specifies some internal values 


to write the drvier forthe simulation, we need to define first the function which store the diffrent devices and its charachteristics

sitation update : 17.07.2025

currently we have driver the could class the base class and start the simualtion 
there is two staff remaiing that first we should be able to write the simualtion variable into some register

and two we have to come up to have list that driver could have id and we could be able to class the functionality from the web UI



as next step we should write the scond driver, and then adapt the main part that could handel as many driver as we add
the abstraction that could call as many driver as possible with main and use the base functionaliy and handover this abstraction 
into the one web UI thing


need to add the manufactuere
_____________________________________________________




1. I have to be able to have two drvier and make the------done
2.  diriver simulation as abstract and  -----done  
3. and write the cmake that contain all the driver and put it in the signle -----done

 

4. design the web UI and try to controll all the functionalyitiy inside the web UI
5. find a way to to write the register into some register and try to have the slcore that could read this register at the same time
